The DRC Plug Task involves unplugging a power cable from one socket and plugging it into another. The problem involves detecting a deformable cable in a noisy environment, grasping the cable with a feasible grasp pose, controlling the shape of the cable to match with the target pose, and inserting the cable-tip to the target socket.
