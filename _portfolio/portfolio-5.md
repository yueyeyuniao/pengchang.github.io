This challenge was aimed at looking for unique use cases for the Panasonic Prototype 3D LiDAR. We proposed to use the Panasonic prototype 3D LiDAR to help with developing intelligent wheel-chairs to provide disabled people with independent mobility from home to work and back to home. We mapped the environment by using SLAM with LiDAR and performed pedestrian detection and tracking using point cloud from the Panasonic LiDAR.
