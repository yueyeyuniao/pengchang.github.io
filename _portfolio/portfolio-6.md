To complete three inspection tasks such as counting containers, recording their ID tags and performing gamma measurements in the nuclear power plant environment, we used a Jackal (UGV) robot with ROS, slam, mapping, real-time object detection, obstacle pose estimation and self-designed scissor lift in this competition. We were the only U.S. team selected to demonstrate the system on 20-24 November 2017 in Brisbane.
