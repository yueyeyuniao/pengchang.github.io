The plug task, motivated by the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals, involves inserting a plug connected with a cable into a paired socket. The human holds the socket while the robot is grasping the cable and manages to insert the plug. Experiments show that the plug task can be completed using our shared control method within 7 seconds.
