To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world, we came up with a new strategy called Simulation-to-Real-to-Simulation. The left figure shows the pipeline of the Sim2Real2Sim strategy we will use for bridging the gap. We start with a rough simulation environment with the estimated models. Then we test the system framework in the real world based on the methods developed in simulation and collect the data from the real world. Finally, we go back to the simulation and update the models and methods based on the data from the real world.

In this work, we built a physical model of the cable-like objects with the identified parameters and implemented a Sim2Real2Sim strategy to narrow the gap between simulation and real-world in deformable object manipulation. The overall result is a high-fidelity simulation environment for deformable object manipulation.
