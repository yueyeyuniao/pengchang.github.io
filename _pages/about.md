Hello, I'm Peng Chang, aÂ Ph.D. graduated from Northeastern University in 2021.<br>
I was a researcher at the [Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research (RIVeR) Lab](http://robot.neu.edu/) led by Prof. Taskin Padir.<br>
My main contribution is model-based manipulation of deformable linear objects, task automation in simulation and real-world, and shared control for human-robot collaboration.<br>
Now I'm working as a senior software engineer at BST focused on auto perception solution.<br>
