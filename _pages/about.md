Hello, I'm Peng Chang, a Ph.D. graduated from Northeastern University in 2021. I was a researcher at the [Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research (RIVeR) Lab](http://robot.neu.edu/) led by Prof. Taskin Padir. My main contribution is model-based manipulation of deformable linear objects, task automation in simulation and real-world, and shared control for human-robot collaboration. 

I'm interested in Robotics including Deformable Object Manipulation, Grasping and Manipulation, Perception for Navigation, Task and Motion Planning, Manipulation Planning, Visual Servoing, Robot Simulation, Task Automation, and Human-Robot Collaboration.

Now I'm working as a senior software engineer at BST focused on auto perception solution.
